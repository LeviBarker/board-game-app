Settlers seeking fresh lives and opportunities strike out to tame wild lands and build new cities. These new cities rely on young railroads for vital goods. Trails become rails and create great wealth. While the crowded East still offers options, its resources dwindle. Look west to make your fortune. Smart money seeks rich, unclaimed land and hungry new markets. Finance your settlers as they head west to build capitals of tomorrow. Link these cities with rails of steel. Operate your railroad to supply the townsfolk with goods. Go west. Settle the wide, open land. Claim your destiny. Settlers of America, Trails to Rails utilizes the simple, fun Catan hex-tile grid to map the young United States.

The house must be placed in the right spot in the village. Then the resources are returned to the board so they can be collected again.

      "description": "One of the most successful games of all time, Settlers of Catan is a trading and building game set in the mythical world of Catan. Players roll dice to determine which resources are generated each round and then must strategically trade those resources with other players to get what they need to build their settlements, cities, and roads. With multiple ways to gain victory points and a board that changes in every play, Settlers of Catan is a game that can be played hundreds of different ways. The base of a hugely successful franchise, with multiple engaging expansions, Settlers is the core game of many collections, and is a wonderful way to spend time with family and friends.

A cooperation of the Crop Trust and Catan, this scenario allows players to experience mankind`s vital struggle for seed diversity. Players balance their individual need to harvest crops versus their collective need to store seeds for future use. By harvesting too many crops, they endanger the seed diversity necessary to a healthy environment. In so doing, they threaten their world with mass extinctions and a collapse of the food supply.",

Of course the settlers of Catan want to make money from these scarce resources. But the resources first need to be moved to the coast, and from there overseas to the home island.
